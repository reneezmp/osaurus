//
//  ModelPickerItemCacheTests.swift
//  osaurusTests
//
//  Regression tests for the launch-time race that caused remote-provider
//  models to disappear from the model picker until the user disconnected
//  and reconnected the provider.
//
//  The cache is a process-wide singleton driven by NotificationCenter, so
//  these tests mostly verify invariants of the serialized rebuild path:
//
//  1. Concurrent callers of `buildModelPickerItems()` are coalesced and all
//     return the same final list.
//  2. `items` is never transiently emptied while a rebuild is in flight
//     (the bug previously was caused by `invalidateCache()` running inside
//     the notification observer).
