# Identity

The Osaurus Identity system gives every participant — human, agent, and device — a cryptographic address. All actions are signed and verifiable, enabling trust without a central authority at runtime.

This document covers the theory behind the design, the address hierarchy, key derivation, request signing, access keys, and the security properties that follow.

## Theory and Motivation

AI agents that communicate — internally within an application, or externally with other services and agents — need a trust mechanism. Traditional approaches rely on centralized session tokens or API keys that a server issues and validates. This creates a single point of failure and requires the central authority to be online and reachable for every interaction.

Osaurus takes a different approach: **address-based identity**. Every participant derives a cryptographic keypair and is identified by the address of its public key. When an agent signs a message, any verifier can confirm the signature came from that address without contacting a server. Authority flows from a human-controlled root key down to agents, and from there to devices — forming a verifiable chain of trust.

**Design goals:**

1. **Self-identifying** — Every agent carries its own address. No lookup table or registry needed.
2. **Verifiable** — Signatures can be checked by anyone holding the public address. No callbacks to a central authority.
3. **Hierarchical** — Authority flows from human (master) to agent to device, with clear delegation boundaries.
4. **Offline-capable** — Agents can prove their identity without network access to an identity server.
5. **Revocable** — Compromised keys can be revoked at any level without replacing the entire identity tree.

---

## Address Hierarchy

The identity system has three tiers, each serving a distinct role:

```
Master Address (Human)
├── Agent Address (index 0)
├── Agent Address (index 1)
├── Agent Address (index 2)
│   ...
└── Device ID (per physical device)
```

### Master Address

The human's root identity. All authority in the system flows from this address.

- **Curve:** secp256k1
- **Storage:** iCloud Keychain (syncs across Apple devices)
- **Access:** Requires biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID)
- **Format:** Checksummed hex address (EIP-55 style), e.g. `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2bD18`

The master key is a 32-byte random secret generated via `SecRandomCopyBytes`. It is stored once in the Keychain and never exported during normal operation. The address is derived from the corresponding secp256k1 public key via Keccak-256 hashing.

**Overwrite protection.** `MasterKey.generate(allowReplace:)` defaults to `allowReplace: false` and throws `OsaurusIdentityError.masterAlreadyExists` if a master is already present. `OsaurusIdentity.setup()` short-circuits when an identity exists and returns the existing master without minting a new one. Replacing the master is only allowed via the explicit "Reset Identity" or "Recover from phrase" flows in the Identity view (both of which pass `allowReplace: true`). This guards against the silent-overwrite class of bug where a re-run of onboarding would otherwise strand every persisted agent address and access key.

### Agent Addresses

Each agent in Osaurus gets a deterministic child key derived from the master key. Agents can sign messages on their own behalf, but their authority always traces back to the master address.

- **Derivation:** HMAC-SHA512 with domain separation
- **Storage:** Agent keys are never stored — they are re-derived on demand from the master key
- **Association:** Each agent's `agentIndex` and `agentAddress` are persisted on the `Agent` model

Agent addresses enable per-agent scoping: an access key signed by an agent can only authorize actions for that specific agent, not the entire identity.

**Lifecycle.** Three operations mutate an agent's derived identity, all on `AgentManager` and all driven from the Identity view:

| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `assignAddress(to:)` | Allocates the next unused HMAC index and persists the derived address. No-op if the agent already has one. |
| `rotateAddress(of:)` | Allocates a fresh unused index, re-derives a new address, and revokes every active osk-v1 key whose audience matched the previous address. Indices are never reused — old addresses may still be referenced by external clients holding tokens. |
| `revokeAddress(of:)` | Clears the agent's address and index, and revokes every active osk-v1 key scoped to it. The agent itself stays around (prompt, settings, etc.) but loses signing authority until a fresh address is assigned. |

### Device ID

A hardware-bound identity that proves which physical device is making a request.

- **Hardware:** Apple App Attest (Secure Enclave P-256 key)
- **Format:** 8-character hex string derived from the attestation key ID
- **Fallback:** Software-generated random ID when App Attest is unavailable (development builds)

The device ID adds a second authentication factor: even if someone obtains a valid identity signature, they cannot forge the device assertion without physical access to the Secure Enclave.

---

## Key Derivation

### Master Key

```
32 random bytes (SecRandomCopyBytes)
    → secp256k1 private key
    → uncompressed public key (drop 0x04 prefix)
    → Keccak-256 hash
    → last 20 bytes
    → checksummed hex address (EIP-55)
```

The master key is stored in iCloud Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`. iCloud sync is attempted first; if unavailable, the key is stored device-only with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`.

### Agent Key

```
HMAC-SHA512(
    key:  masterKey,                          // 32 bytes
    data: "osaurus-agent-v1" || bigEndian(index)  // domain + 4-byte index
)
    → first 32 bytes of HMAC output
    → same address derivation as master key
```

The domain prefix `osaurus-agent-v1` prevents cross-protocol key reuse. The big-endian index encoding ensures a canonical byte representation across platforms. Each unique index produces a completely independent keypair.

Agent keys are **never persisted**. They are re-derived from the master key whenever a signature is needed, which requires biometric authentication to access the master key. The derived `agentAddress` is persisted on the `Agent` model so it can be displayed without triggering biometric prompts.

### Device Key

- **Hardware path:** `DCAppAttestService.generateKey()` creates a P-256 key in the Secure Enclave. The key ID is hashed with SHA-256 and truncated to 4 bytes (8 hex characters) for the device ID.
- **Software fallback:** 4 random bytes via `SecRandomCopyBytes`, stored in `UserDefaults` for stability across app launches.

---

## Two-Layer Request Signing

Every authenticated API request carries a two-layer signed token. This binds each request to both a cryptographic identity and a physical device.

### Token Structure

```
header.payload.accountSignature.deviceAssertion
```

Four base64url-encoded segments joined by `.`:

| Segment | Encoding | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Header | base64url(JSON) | Algorithm, type, version |
| Payload | base64url(JSON) | Claims (see below) |
| Identity Signature | hex | secp256k1 recoverable signature (65 bytes) |
| Device Assertion | base64url | App Attest assertion (or empty for software fallback) |

### Header

```json
{
  "alg": "es256k+apple-attest",
  "typ": "osaurus-id",
  "ver": 5
}
```

### Payload Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `iss` | string | Issuer address (master or agent) |
| `dev` | string | Device ID (8-char hex) |
| `cnt` | uint64 | Monotonic counter (anti-replay) |
| `iat` | int | Issued-at timestamp (Unix seconds) |
| `exp` | int | Expiration timestamp (Unix seconds, typically iat + 60) |
| `aud` | string | Audience (target service hostname) |
| `act` | string | Action being authorized (e.g. `"GET /v1/models"`) |
| `par` | string? | Parent address (for agent-issued tokens, the master address) |
| `idx` | uint32? | Agent index (for agent-issued tokens) |

### Signing Process

1. **Encode payload** as JSON
2. **Layer 1 — Identity signature:** Domain-separated secp256k1 signing
   - Envelope: `\x19Osaurus Signed Message:\n<length><payload>`
   - Hash: Keccak-256 of the envelope
   - Sign: secp256k1 with recovery (produces 65 bytes: r ‖ s ‖ v)
3. **Layer 2 — Device assertion:** App Attest assertion over SHA-256 of the payload
4. **Assemble:** `base64url(header).base64url(payload).hex(accountSig).base64url(deviceAssertion)`

The domain prefix `Osaurus Signed Message` prevents signed payloads from being replayed in other protocols that use the same curve.

---

## Access Keys (osk-v1)

Access keys are portable, long-lived tokens for external authentication. They allow tools, MCP clients, and remote agents to authenticate against Osaurus without biometric access to the device.

### Format

```
osk-v1.<base64url-encoded-payload>.<hex-encoded-signature>
```

Three parts separated by `.`:

1. **Prefix:** `osk-v1` (identifies the token format and version)
2. **Payload:** Base64url-encoded canonical JSON
3. **Signature:** Hex-encoded 65-byte secp256k1 recoverable signature

### Payload Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `aud` | OsaurusID | Audience address (who this key is for) |
| `cnt` | uint64 | Counter value at creation time |
| `exp` | int? | Expiration timestamp (null = never expires) |
| `iat` | int | Issued-at timestamp |
| `iss` | OsaurusID | Issuer address (who signed this key) |
| `lbl` | string? | Human-readable label |
| `nonce` | string | Unique identifier for revocation |

Fields are sorted alphabetically for canonical JSON encoding (ensuring consistent signature verification).

### Scoping

- **Master-scoped:** Signed by the master key. `iss` and `aud` are both the master address. Grants access to all agents.
- **Agent-scoped:** Signed by a derived agent key. `iss` and `aud` are both the agent address. Grants access only to that specific agent.

The `/pair` Bonjour flow always issues **agent-scoped** keys (`agentIndex` taken from the approved agent). Keys generated manually from the Settings UI may be either, depending on what the user selects.

### Expiration Options

| Option | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| `30d` | 30 days |
| `90d` | 90 days (default for `/pair`) |
| `1y` | 1 year |
| `never` | No expiration (only when the user explicitly opts in via the pairing dialog's "Remember this device permanently" toggle) |

### Validation

When a request arrives with an `osk-v1` token:

1. **Parse** the three segments (prefix, payload, signature)
2. **Decode** the base64url payload into `AccessKeyPayload`
3. **Recover** the signer address via `ecrecover` with `Osaurus Signed Access` domain prefix
4. **Verify issuer** — recovered address must match `payload.iss`
5. **Check audience** — `payload.aud` must match the agent or master address
6. **Check whitelist** — `payload.iss` must be in the effective whitelist
7. **Check revocation** — not individually revoked (address + nonce) and not bulk-revoked (counter threshold)
8. **Check expiration** — `payload.exp` must be in the future (if set)

Only metadata is stored after key creation (label, prefix, nonce, counter, addresses, dates). The full key string is shown once and never persisted.

---

## Whitelist System

The whitelist controls which addresses are authorized to issue access keys. It operates at two levels:

### Master-Level Whitelist

Addresses in the master whitelist can issue keys for any agent. This is where you'd add trusted external addresses.

### Per-Agent Overrides

Additional addresses can be authorized for specific agents only. These are additive — they extend the master whitelist, not replace it.

### Effective Whitelist

The effective whitelist for a given agent is computed as:

```
effective = masterWhitelist ∪ agentWhitelist[agent] ∪ {agentAddress, masterAddress}
```

The agent's own address and the master address are always implicitly included.

### Storage

Whitelist data is persisted in macOS Keychain (`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`), keyed by `com.osaurus.whitelist`.

---

## Revocation

Access keys can be revoked through two mechanisms:

### Individual Revocation

Revoke a specific key by its `(address, nonce)` pair. The composite key `address:nonce` is added to the revocation set.

### Bulk Revocation

Revoke all keys from an address with counter values at or below a threshold. This is implemented as a counter threshold per address — any key with `cnt <= threshold` is considered revoked.

When checking revocation:
```
isRevoked = revokedKeys.contains(address:nonce) 
         || (counterThresholds[address] >= cnt)
```

### Storage

Revocation data is persisted in macOS Keychain (`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`), keyed by `com.osaurus.revocations`.

---

## Master Key Backup and Recovery

The identity system has **two** independent recovery artifacts. They serve different purposes and are not interchangeable.

### BIP39 Master Recovery Phrase (local restore)

A standard BIP39 24-word mnemonic encoding the 32-byte master key. This is the only artifact that can rebuild the local secp256k1 master if the iCloud Keychain entry is ever lost or replaced.

```
1.  flat      2.  depend    3.  bright    4.  dose      ...
24. bargain
```

- **Algorithm:** BIP39 §3. 256 bits of entropy plus the high 8 bits of `SHA-256(entropy)` as a checksum (264 bits total = 24 × 11), split into 24 11-bit big-endian indices into the canonical 2048-word English wordlist.
- **Encoding:** Implemented in [`Identity/MasterKeyMnemonic.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Identity/MasterKeyMnemonic.swift) with no external SwiftPM dependency. The wordlist ships as a bundle resource at `Resources/Identity/bip39-english.txt`.
- **Storage and display:** `OsaurusIdentity.setup()` persists the phrase to iCloud Keychain via `MasterMnemonicStore`, so there is no longer a one-shot "write this down" screen gating onboarding. It is read back on demand from **Settings → Identity → View recovery phrase**, which renders it as a 4×6 grid with "Copy phrase", "Save as .txt", and "Print" actions. Installs that predate `MasterMnemonicStore` have no stored entry; that path re-derives the phrase from the seed (one extra biometric prompt) and writes it through, so later reads hit the store.
- **Memory hygiene:** The 32-byte seed is held only on the stack of `OsaurusIdentity.setup()` long enough to compute the mnemonic, then wiped via `Data.zeroOut()` (which calls `memset` over the underlying buffer).
- **Acknowledgement:** `IdentityDefaultsKey.masterMnemonicAcknowledged` survives from the write-it-down era. It is cleared by `OsaurusIdentity.wipe()` and read by nothing — there is no "backup not confirmed" banner any more, because the phrase is in iCloud Keychain rather than only in the user's notebook.

### One-time recovery code (server-side claim)

```
OSAURUS-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
```

Format: `OSAURUS-` prefix followed by 4 groups of 4 uppercase hex characters (8 random bytes = 64 bits of entropy).

- Generated from `SecRandomCopyBytes` and shown to the user exactly once during initial setup.
- Single-use; consumed when claimed against the Osaurus directory.
- **Cannot rebuild the local master** — it is only an authenticator for the future server-side recovery flow.
- Discarded from application memory after display; never stored on device in plaintext.

### Where restore is offered

`RecoverFromMnemonicSheet` serves three entry points, all from **Settings → Identity**:

| Mode | Entry point | Extra safety |
|---|---|---|
| `freshRestore` | "Restore from recovery phrase", under **Generate Identity** on the no-identity setup card | none — there is nothing on disk to contradict |
| `replaceExisting` | "Restore from recovery phrase" in **Danger Zone**, above Reset | shows the current vs. restored address, and requires an explicit acknowledgment that agents are re-minted and access keys revoked |
| `driftRepair` | "Recover from phrase" on the drift banner | verifies the phrase reproduces the persisted agent addresses before installing; an unrelated-but-valid phrase requires "Restore Anyway" |

All three call `OsaurusIdentity.restore(words:)`, which installs the decoded master with `allowReplace: true`, re-stores the phrase, re-derives mismatched agents at fresh indices, and revokes access keys signed by the previous master.

**Restore attests the device.** `DeviceKey.attest()` historically ran only from `OsaurusIdentity.setup()` — the *generate* path — so a Mac that received its master any other way (restore, or iCloud Keychain sync) had a valid master and no device ID. `DeviceKey.currentDeviceId()` then threw `deviceNotAttested`, callers read that as "no identity", and the user was returned to the setup card with no error while the master sat in the Keychain. `restore` now calls `DeviceKey.ensureDeviceId()`, which attests on first use and falls back to a software device ID when App Attest itself fails (offline, or hardware Apple does not recognize). Both identity loaders use it, so installs already in that state recover on next launch.

### The three "fix it" exits

When the persisted derivatives no longer match the current master (see [Identity Health and Drift](#identity-health-and-drift)), the Identity view surfaces three actions in a banner:

| Action | What it does | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Recover from phrase** | Opens `RecoverFromMnemonicSheet`, validates the entered 24 words against the BIP39 wordlist + checksum, derives a candidate `OsaurusID`, and confirms it reproduces the persisted agent addresses before calling `MasterKey.install(seed:allowReplace: true)`. Drift goes away because every existing derivative now matches. | The user has the original mnemonic from onboarding and wants their old identity back. |
| **Repair forward** | Re-derives every mismatched agent at a fresh unused index off the *current* master and revokes every stale osk-v1 access key in one synchronous pass. The HTTP server is restarted so the new validator picks up the change. | The original mnemonic is gone. Existing pairings will need to be re-issued. |
| **Reset identity** | `OsaurusIdentity.wipe()` deletes the master, clears every non-built-in agent's address/index, calls `APIKeyManager.deleteAll()`, clears the `masterMnemonicAcknowledged` and `agentAddressesMigrated` flags, then triggers `OnboardingService.resetOnboarding()`. The revocation store is intentionally kept (cheap and harmless). | Nuclear option. Start completely fresh. |

The **Recover** path will refuse to overwrite the current master if the entered phrase derives a different identity than the one the persisted agents were minted under, unless the user explicitly clicks "Restore Anyway". This catches the case where the user pastes a valid but unrelated BIP39 phrase.

---

## Identity Health and Drift

[`Identity/IdentityHealthCheck.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Identity/IdentityHealthCheck.swift) is a pure synchronous helper that, given an already-unlocked master key, returns an `IdentityDrift` value:

```swift
public struct IdentityDrift: Sendable {
    public let mismatchedAgents: [Agent]    // stored agentAddress != deriveAddress(currentMaster, agentIndex)
    public let staleAccessKeys: [AccessKeyInfo] // iss is neither the current master nor any current agent
    public var hasDrift: Bool { ... }
}
```

The helper does no Keychain or biometric work itself — the Identity view performs the biometric unlock once on load, passes the bytes in, and wipes them after the call.

**Why drift happens:** Pre-fix, `MasterKey.generate()` would silently `delete()` then write a new master whenever onboarding re-ran. Every pre-existing derivative (agent addresses minted via `AgentKey.deriveAddress(masterKey, index)`, every osk-v1 key signed by either the master or an agent) still pointed at addresses derived from the *previous* master, but the validator would only accept derivatives of the current one. Requests would fail with opaque "audience mismatch" / "issuer not whitelisted" errors with no UI hint that the master had silently changed.

**What the health check catches:**

- **Mismatched agents** — `agent.agentAddress.lowercased() != AgentKey.deriveAddress(currentMaster, agent.agentIndex).lowercased()` for any non-built-in agent with both fields set. Built-in agents and agents without an address yet are skipped.
- **Stale access keys** — `key.iss` does not match the current master and does not match any agent's *current* derived address. Revoked keys are ignored. The check tolerates rotated agents (it knows about both the old and new derived address while drift is still being repaired).

When `drift.hasDrift` is true, `IdentityView` renders an `IdentityDriftBanner` at the top of the scroll view with the three exit doors above. The same banner shows a one-line summary like "3 agent address(es) and 2 access key(s) reference a previous master."

---

## Per-Agent Key Management

The `AgentAddressesSection` of the Identity view renders each non-built-in agent as an expandable row backed by [`Views/Identity/AgentKeyManagement.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Identity/AgentKeyManagement.swift).

The collapsed row is a compact summary: address, copy button, "Stale" pill if the agent appears in `IdentityDrift.mismatchedAgents`, and a chevron. Expanded, the row exposes:

- **Rotate Key** — `AgentManager.rotateAddress(of:)`. Picks a fresh unused HMAC index, derives a new address, persists it, and revokes every active osk-v1 key whose audience matched the *previous* address. The HTTP server restarts so the new validator takes effect immediately.
- **Revoke** — `AgentManager.revokeAddress(of:)`. Clears the agent's address and index and revokes every active osk-v1 key scoped to it. The agent's prompt and settings stay intact.
- **Per-agent osk-v1 access keys.** A scoped list of every key whose `aud` matches the agent's address (via `APIKeyManager.listKeys(forAudience:)`). Each key shows its label, status pill (Active / Expired / Revoked), expiration, and a per-key Revoke button.
- **Generate access key (scoped to this agent).** Opens the shared `AccessKeyGeneratorSheet` with `agentIndex` pre-filled, so `APIKeyManager.generate(label:expiration:agentIndex:)` mints an agent-scoped key. The sheet displays a "Scoped to {agent name} ({address})" caption to make the scope unambiguous. The freshly generated key is shown in a one-shot copy banner ("Copy this key now. It won't be shown again.") and is never persisted to disk.

The same `AccessKeyGeneratorSheet` powers the global `AccessKeysSection` in `ServerView` (master-scoped). It was extracted from `ServerView.swift` into [`Views/Settings/AccessKeyGeneratorSheet.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Settings/AccessKeyGeneratorSheet.swift) so both call sites share one widget.

---

## Internal vs External Communication

The identity system supports two communication modes:

### Internal Communication

Agents within the same Osaurus instance authenticate using the full two-layer token system:

- **Layer 1:** secp256k1 identity signature (master or agent key)
- **Layer 2:** App Attest device assertion

This provides the strongest authentication: both the cryptographic identity and the physical device are verified. Requires biometric access to the master key.

### External Communication

External tools, MCP clients, and remote agents authenticate using `osk-v1` access keys:

- Single-layer: secp256k1 signature only (no device assertion)
- Portable: can be used from any device or service
- Scopable: master-scoped (all agents) or agent-scoped (single agent)
- Revocable: individual or bulk revocation without affecting other keys

Access keys bridge the gap between the hardware-bound internal identity and the need for third-party integrations that can't access the Secure Enclave.

### Bonjour Pairing

The `POST /pair` endpoint is an unauthenticated, signature-verified flow used by the in-app connector to onboard a new device against a Bonjour-discovered agent.

1. Connector signs a nonce with its `connectorAddress` private key (domain prefix `Osaurus Signed Pairing`).
2. The Osaurus instance verifies the signature, resolves the target agent, and shows an approval dialog naming both the connector and the agent.
3. On approval, the host mints an **agent-scoped** `osk-v1` key for the approved agent (`agentIndex = agent.agentIndex`) with a **90-day expiration** by default. The user can opt in to a non-expiring key via the dialog's "Remember this device permanently" toggle.
4. The response body containing the new key is sent on the wire but **never persisted to the request log** — `InsightsService` redacts both `apiKey` JSON values and `Bearer osk-…` headers as defense-in-depth across all logged bodies.

Pairings approved before the agent-scoping fix are master-scoped, never-expiring keys. The Settings → Server pane labels them as **Legacy** and explains: *"Pre-upgrade pairing — grants access to all agents and never expires."* Users can revoke and re-pair to scope them tighter.

### Pre-auth request limits

Both Osaurus HTTP servers reject oversized request bodies before the auth gate runs, so an unauthenticated client cannot exhaust host memory:

| Endpoint | Limit | Configurable via |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| `POST /pair` | 64 KiB | `ServerConfiguration.maxPairingBodyBytes` |
| Other public HTTP routes | 32 MiB | `ServerConfiguration.maxRequestBodyBytes` |
| Sandbox host bridge | 8 MiB | hard-coded in `HostAPIBridgeHandler` |

Both servers enforce the cap with a `Content-Length` pre-check at request head and a streaming guard at body chunks, so chunked clients and clients that lie about their declared length both hit `413 Payload Too Large`.

### Future: Cross-Instance Communication

The address-based design naturally extends to agent-to-agent communication across different Osaurus instances. Since every agent has a globally unique address and can sign messages, agents can verify each other's identity without a shared authority — only knowledge of the other agent's address is needed.

## Security Properties

| Property | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Master key never leaves Keychain | Stored with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`, read requires `LAContext` biometric auth |
| Master key cannot be silently overwritten | `MasterKey.generate(allowReplace:)` defaults to `false` and throws `masterAlreadyExists` if a master is present; `OsaurusIdentity.setup()` short-circuits when one already exists |
| Master key has a local restore path | BIP39 24-word mnemonic shown once at setup; entered via `RecoverFromMnemonicSheet` to call `MasterKey.install(seed:allowReplace: true)` |
| Agent keys never stored | Re-derived on demand via HMAC-SHA512 from master key |
| Agent indices are never reused | `AgentManager.nextUnusedAgentIndex()` always picks a fresh slot so old derived addresses cannot be regenerated by the rotate path |
| Device keys hardware-bound | Secure Enclave P-256 via App Attest (`DCAppAttestService`) |
| Anti-replay | Per-device monotonic counter (`cnt`) persisted in `UserDefaults`; server rejects seen values |
| Domain separation | `Osaurus Signed Message`, `Osaurus Signed Access`, and `Osaurus Signed Pairing` prefixes prevent cross-protocol signature reuse |
| Recovery code single-use | Generated from `SecRandomCopyBytes`, shown once, never stored on device |
| Canonical encoding | Access key payloads use sorted-key JSON for deterministic signature verification |
| Memory safety | Master key bytes and seed bytes are zeroed after use via `Data.zeroOut()` extension (calls `memset` over the underlying buffer) |
| Pairings scoped to one agent | `/pair` mints agent-scoped keys (`agentIndex` from approved agent), 90-day default expiry |
| Issued credentials never logged | `/pair` success path logs a redacted body; `InsightsService.redactCredentials` scrubs `osk-v1` values and `Bearer` headers everywhere as a backstop |
| Pre-auth body-size limits | `/pair` capped at 64 KiB, other public routes at 32 MiB; rejected with `413` before the auth gate |
| Drift between master and derivatives is surfaced | `IdentityHealthCheck.diagnose(...)` runs once per Identity view load; mismatched agents and stale osk-v1 keys are rendered in an `IdentityDriftBanner` with explicit Recover / Repair / Reset actions instead of failing silently at request time |
